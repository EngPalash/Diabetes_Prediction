Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

In this project, we systematically constructed and evaluated various machine learning models to predict diabetes. The dataset used is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on specific diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

Here are the key steps and models used:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization:
We started by understanding the dataset through exploratory data analysis and visualizations.
This step helped us gain insights into the dataâ€™s characteristics.

Data Correlation Analysis:
We explored relationships and dependencies among variables.
Understanding correlations is crucial for feature selection and model building.

Model Building:
We constructed several machine learning models:
Random Forest Model: Achieved an accuracy score of 80.2% in diabetes prediction.
Decision Tree Model: Achieved an accuracy score of 74.0%.
KNN Classsifier: Achieved an accuracy score of 81%.
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model: Achieved an accuracy score of 75.5%.
Conclusion:
After evaluating these models, we found that the Random Forest model performed the best with an accuracy of 80.2%.
Our project emphasizes not only model building but also data analysis and visualization.
